QUICK START:
This mode is just normal Tetris. Outlast Opponent to win.

COOPERATIVE:
This mode requires team work. Lines will not dissappear unless both
players have the same lines completed.

COMPETITIVE:
This mode allows you to mess with your opponents game. Simply rack up points to
either send a line up or make the opponents piece drop for two points each.
Score is based on how many lines you have completed. There are twenty pieces per
round and first to go through all the pieces is saved from getting a line pushed
up to their board. The blocks get faster as rounds progress.
